I'm a Senior Research Scientist at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google). I've been working on [LearnLM](https://arxiv.org/2412.16429), Google's approach to finetuning LLMs for pedagogy. I graduated from my PhD in [Computer Science](https://cogsci.tufts.edu)/[Cognitive Science](https://www.cs.tufts.edu) at Tufts University in 2022, supervised by Prof. Matthias Scheutz in the [Human-Robot Interaction Lab](https://hrilab.tufts.edu).

When I'm not doing research, I'm probably performing in the Montreal community/independent musical theatre scene.
